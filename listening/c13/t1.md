Hello, to rest information center.
Mike speaking, how can I help you?
Oh hi, I want to find out about cookery classes.
I believe there are some one-day classes for tourists.
Will they are open to everyone.
but tourists are always welcome.
ok, let me give you some details what's available.
there are several classes
one very popular one is at a food studio
ok
they focus on seasonal products
and as well as teaching you how to cook them
they also show you how to choose them
right, that sounds good, how big the class is
i'm not sure exactly, but they'll be quite small
and could i get a private lesson there
i think so, let me check, yes, they do offer those
though in fact most of the people who attend the classes find it's a nice wave getting to know another
i suppose it must be yes
and this company has a special deal for clients where they are for a discount of 20% if you return for further class
ok but you said there were several classes
that's right
another one you might be interested in is bones cookery school
they are quite new, they just open six months ago
but i've heard good things about them
they concentrate on teaching you to prepare healthy food
and they have quite a lot of specially staff
so is that food for paper on a diet, and things like that
i don't know if i be interested in that
well, i don't think they particularly focus on low-calory diets or weight loss
it's more todo with recipes that look at specific needs
like including ingredients that will help build up your bones and make them stronger, that's all the thing
i see, well, i might be interested, i'm not sure
do they have a website i could check
yes, just key in the name of school, it'll come up
and if you want to know more about them
every thursday evening, they have a lecture at school
it's free, and you don't need to book or anything
just turn up at seven thirty
and that might give you an idea of whether you want to go to a next class
ok this is one more place you might be interested in
that's got a rather strange name, it's called
the arretsa center, that spelled 'arretsa'
ok
they've got a very good reputation
they do a bit of meat and fish cookery but they mostly specialize in vegetarian dishes
right, they's certainly an area i'd like to learn more about
i've got lots of friends who don't eat meat
in fact, i think i might have seen that school today
is it just by the market
that's right
so they don't have any problem getting many ingredients
there right next door
and they also offer a special 2 hour course in how to use a knife
they cover all the different skills
bite, shopny, chopping techniques
it gets book top quickly though ,so you need to check it with available
right well, thank you very muck

Good evening everyone, my name is fill certain, and im the chairman of the committee
we've called this meeting to inform members of the public about the new regulations for traffic and parking we're proposing for Granford
i'll start by summrizing these changes before we open the meeting to questions
so why do we need to make these changes to traffic systems in granford, well, we're very aware the traffic is becoming an increasing problem
it's been especially noticable with increasing heavy traffic where they are been building the hospital
today, there's not many increasing traffic accidents but that's not something what we want to see happen obviously
we recently carried out a survey of local residents, and their responses were interesting
people were very concerned about the lack of visibility on some roads, due to cars parked on the sides of roads 
we expected to complain about the conjestion near the school when parents are dropping their children or pick them up
but this was on the top of list and nor were noise and fuse from trucks and lorries, though they were mentioned by some people
we think these new traffic regulations will make a lot of difference
we've managed to keep out proposals within budget just so they can coord by council
but of course it's no good introducing new regulations if we don't have a way of making sure that everyone will obey them
and that's an area we're still working on with the help of representatives from the place force
ok, so this slide shows the map of the central areas of granford with the high street in the middle and the school road on the right
now we all ready have a set of traffic lights in the high street of the junction with station road
but we are planning to have another set at the other end of the school road junction to regulate the flow of traffic along the high street
we've decided we definitily need a pedestrain crossing , we considered putting this on  school road just outside the school
but in the end we decided that could lead to a traffic congestion , so we decided located on high street, crossing the road in front of the supermarket
that's a very busy area so it's true to help things there
we're proposing some changes to parking, at present, parking isn't allowed on the high street outside the library
we're going to change that and allow parking there, but not of all the land of the high street near school road
there'll be a new no-parking side on the school road, just by the entrance to the school forbidding parking for 25 meters
this should improve visibility for drivers and pedesdrains, especially on the band just the north of the school
as far as disabled drivers concerned, at present, they have parking outside the supermarket, but lorries also use those spaces
so we've got two new disabled parking spaces on the side road, off to the bank, it's not ideal but proberbelly better than the present arrangement
we also plan to widen the pavement on school road, we think we can manage to get next half meters on the band just before we get to the school on the side of the road.
finally, we've introduced new restrictions on loading and unloading for the supermarket so lorries are only been allowed to stop there before atm
that's the supermarket on school road
we kept to the existing arrangements with the high street supermarket
ok, so that's about it
