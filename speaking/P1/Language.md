A:
1. Chinese is my mother tongue, and i also possess an intermediate proficiency in English. If my memory is correct, i learnt English when I was a pupil, and my interest in its rich phonetics and culture has kept me engaged.
2. In the future, I possibly intend to learn Japanese. Cuz I am such a big fan of Japanese cartoons. As a matter of fact, watching cartoons without subtitles really attracts me.
3. Generally, there are several steps. In the first place, I build my vocabulary, then I begin to read sentences to grasp grammar, finally, I recite those sentences to improve my intonation and emotion. Besides, the most important thing is repeating these processes again and again.
4. Language lessons in my school were a harmonious blend of traditional and interactive methods. While the curriculum prioritized structured grammar lessons and vocabulary expansion, the educators also emphasized speaking ability. And this method really helps.
