Q: 
1.  Do you want to be a teacher in the future? 
2.  Do you remember one of your teachers?
3.  What were your primary school teachers like? 
4.  Do you have a favorite teacher? 

A:
1. Actually, I haven't really thought about it, but being a teacher seems to be interesting. For instance, you know, sharing knowledge with others is always rewarding. At the same time, our knowledge would be enhanced in this teaching process.
2. Absolutely, Mr. Wang, my high school mathematics teacher, stands out in my memories. He was quite professional in his teaching area, but was really impatient. I can still remember the scenario that he scolded me which left me a lasting impression.
3. It depends on our behaviors. If we took classes carefully, they would show us their caring and loving. In contrast, if we made too many mistakes, they would be mean to us.
4. Indeed, Mr. Yang, my history teacher from middle school was my favorite. I was marveled by his terrific talent of telling history stories, since he made those words come alive which made every class feel like a journey through time rather than just another lesson.
