Q:
1. Do you like ice cream?
2. Did you eat ice cream when you were a child?
3. Are there shops selling ice cream near the place where you live?
4. Can you make ice cream yourself? 

A: 
1. Ice cream is the best! I extremely enjoy the sundae with some toppings. Anyway, whether it's a chocolate flavor or a simple, classical vanilla, ice cream always elevate my mood, especially on a hot summer afternoon.
2. Absolutely, ice cream was a cherished treat during my childhood. Those moments, holding a cone with a scoop of my preferred flavor, while it dripped down my fingers, really left me a lasting impression.
3. Certainly, there are a couple of ice cream parlors near my home, and I often visit them on weekends, enjoy the simple happiness in exploring their diverse flavours.
4. I would argue that I will never make ice cream by myself. I prefer buying one over making something strange.Cuz my cooking skill is really bad. Frankly speaking, I don't want to waste raw materials.
