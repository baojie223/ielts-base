I feel that I have to talk about my friend XZ, who is a very kind and helpful person. We first met as I laboured with my heavy suitcase arriving to my dormitory on the first day of college. When I opened the room door,I saw XZ gazing at me with a smile. He noticed that I had a lot of luggage and came over at once to aid me. I found that he was quite helpful at that time.

XZ was a perfect roommate. He often brought breakfast for us in the dormitory or helped us save seats in class. Although these were small things, they made us feel the warmth of home.

I still remember when I first came to university, I was quite introverted. However, after spending four years together, I realized that I had become more enthusiastic and helpful. Moreover, the atmosphere in our dormitory was the best in the entire class. He used his warmth to connect us all, turning us into great friends.

Until I met XZ's parents, I was always curious about what made him so warm and cheerful. His parents and his personality were one of the same. They are both courteous and very warm-hearted. I believe it must be a family of great kindness, to raise such a fine child. And he once said that everyone encounters difficulties in life. If we help others when they need it, then when we face troubles, there will be someone willing to help us. I truly believe he has great wisdom.

I feel that I have to talk about my friend XZ. He is a very kind person who enjoys cooking. We first met as I laboured with my cumbersome suitcase arriving to my dormitory on the first day of college. When I opened the room door, I saw XZ gazing at me with a smile. he noticed that I had a lot of luggage and came over at once to aid me. Back then, I couldn't help but admire him; he was such a good person.

XZ was a perfect roommate. He enjoys cooking and bought an induction cooker to cook hotpots in the dormitory. On normal days, he often cooked some easy meals for herself and us, like instant noodles with ham and sausage. On days for celebrating, such as public holidays or the end of the final exam, he would buy a lot of ingredients in the food market and come back to make hotpot with us.

I think there are several reasons why he enjoys cooking for others. Firstly, his family owns a restaurant, so he has been interested in cooking from a young age. Secondly, I believe that cooking for us gives him a sense of accomplishment; he always looks very satisfied when we show our compliments about his cooking. Additionally, he is a very warm-hearted person in general. Cooking for us is just one part of it; he also brings us breakfast and saves seats for us. In any case, having a friend like him, I feel very lucky.

I feel that I have to talk about my friend XZ, who is a very interesting and smart person. He is my college roommate. We first met as I laboured with my heavy suitcase arriving to my dormitory on the first day of college. When I opened the room door, I saw XZ gazing at me with a smile. he noticed that I had a lot of luggage and came over at once to aid me.

XZ now owns a hotpot restaurant, right next to our university's shopping center, and I've been there a few times. He serves authentic Chongqing hotpot, but what's more creative is that he added Sichuan Face-Changing Opera performances in his restaurant. Sichuan Face-Changing Opera is a Chinese cultural heritage, where performers rapidly change masks with painted faces of historical Chinese figures. The performance is highly entertaining and has attracted many customers. Additionally, XZ has created various fun videos of his restaurant and shared them on major social media platforms. He has got over ten thousand followers, drawing even more tourists from all over the country to his hotpot restaurant.

XZ's success can be attributed to his personality. He does not toe the line - he always has some novel ideas and puts them into action. As I mentioned before, whether it's adding Sichuan Face-Changing Opera performances or creating short videos, these are ideas that most ordinary people wouldn't think of. This has allowed him to stand out from the majority of hotpot restaurants. I consider XZ to be one of the most outstanding and talented individuals among my peers, and he is a very successful entrepreneur.

On the other hand, I found that Xiao Zhang is good at imitation and learning. We had been to bars with resident singers before, and he drew inspiration from that to introduce performances to his restaurant, which eventually led to the Sichuan Face-Changing Opera in his restaurant. With so many interesting ideas, it's no wonder he's so outstanding now.
