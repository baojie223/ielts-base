I want to share the story of waiting in line for hotpot.

Last month, my girlfriend and I decided to visit a popular hotpot restaurant in town. This place had gained quite a reputation online, with a constant stream of people lining up every day.

From what we knew, the restaurant was renowned for serving authentic Chongqing hotpot with incredibly fresh ingredients, and they even had Sichuan opera performances in the restaurant.

When we arrived at the restaurant, we were shocked. The line of people waiting outside seemed endless, splitting into several long queues. We realized that we would have to wait for several hours at least. However, our curiosity got the best of us, and we decided to brave the two-hour wait and see what all the fuss was about.

In the end, the experience was definitely worth it. We found that the restaurant's hotpot was indeed exceptional, surpassing most others we had tried before. The Sichuan opera performance added to the unique ambiance. But I have to admit, if you asked me to wait for another two hours to eat there, I'd probably decline because it was quite a long wait!

I want to share a terrible experience I had at a hotpot restaurant.

Last month, my girlfriend and I decided to visit a popular hotpot restaurant called dayu hotpot. This place had gained quite a reputation online, with a constant stream of people lining up every day.

Initially, my girlfriend and I were having a great time, enjoying our meal and having a good laugh. Suddenly, my girlfriend noticed something dark in her bowl. At first, we thought it was some seasoning, but upon closer inspection, we were horrified to discover that it was a large clump of dust. To our dismay, we found that there was also a lot of dust in the hotpot itself.

I was quite upset and immediately called over a waiter to inquire about the situation. After examining it, the waiter explained that the dust had fallen from the ceiling and offered to replace our hotpot with a new one. Reluctantly, I agreed to the replacement.

However, just five minutes later, I found a bug in our dishes. This was the last straw for me, and I demanded to speak to the manager. Eventually, the manager agreed not to charge us for the meal, but the whole experience left me quite shocked.

I believe that a restaurant's top priority should be maintaining a clean and hygienic environment for its customers, and this level of service was far below what we expected, given their reputation. Regardless, I have no intention of ever dining there again.

I believe that an advertisement for a hotpot restaurant called "Da Yu" (大渝) is quite effective.

I came across this advertisement on TikTok, and its content was as follows: an actor dressed in Sichuan opera face-changing attire was shown eating hotpot. After taking a spicy bite, the actor would instantly change their face multiple times while continuously eating. By the end of the ad, they had used up all the masks, and then the ad concluded with the slogan: "Da Yu Hotpot, Delicious and Fun."

This advertisement is ingenious because it perfectly highlights two key features of the hotpot restaurant. Firstly, it emphasizes that they serve authentic Chongqing-style hotpot, known for its spiciness, as the actor's multiple face changes are caused by the heat. Secondly, it showcases that the restaurant offers Sichuan opera performances, as the actor changes faces while eating, indicating that customers can enjoy the hotpot while watching the face-changing performance.

I find this advertisement highly successful because it has received over a million likes on TikTok, directly leading to long queues at Da Yu Hotpot every day. Additionally, the ad is creative and incorporates elements of Sichuan opera, which is not something most people would expect. Lastly, it contributes to the promotion of traditional Chinese culture by introducing more people to Sichuan opera. Therefore, I truly appreciate this advertisement.

I once gave a piece of advice to my friend Xiao Zhang regarding his restaurant business.

Xiao Zhang had opened a hot pot restaurant, but his business was struggling, and he shared his concerns with us during a dinner gathering. He asked if we had any suggestions for improvement.

I recommended that he incorporate some live performances into his restaurant. I mentioned that we had been to bars where live singers would entertain the guests. I thought, since bars could have performances, why not have them in a restaurant? Plus, most restaurants in the market didn't offer such a service, so if Xiao Zhang's restaurant did, it would definitely stand out.

Xiao Zhang, to his credit, was bold and immediately adopted my suggestion. It's worth noting that hiring professional performers can be expensive, and he was already facing financial difficulties. Nevertheless, he trusted my advice and went ahead with it. However, he also put his own twist on it by introducing Sichuan opera performances and heavily promoting them. Surprisingly, this move attracted a large number of customers to his restaurant. Xiao Zhang remains grateful to me to this day and believes that without my advice, his restaurant might have closed down long ago.
