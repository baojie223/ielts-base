One of my favorite clothing items is a pair of Alexander McQueen sneakers. In China, they are commonly referred to as "little white shoes" because they have a surface made of pure white cowhide leather and a sole that's about 5 centimeters high, all in a classic sneaker style.

I bought these sneakers as a reward for myself after switching to a higher-paying job last year. It was a way to celebrate the hard work I had put in over the years. I compared prices on several shopping platforms and found that the best deal was on the "Dewu" platform, which also guaranteed authenticity, so I decided to purchase them there.

I usually wear these sneakers every three to four days because they are quite expensive, and I want to prevent excessive wear and tear. However, whenever I go out for special occasions or outings, I always choose to wear them. They look great, and they give me a sense of style.

I truly enjoy wearing these sneakers. Firstly, they are made of leather, so they are comfortable to wear in both winter and summer. Secondly, their design is minimalistic, making them suitable for pairing with most outfits without looking out of place. Lastly, and most importantly, they provide a noticeable height increase. I'm only 170cm tall, which isn't very tall, but when I wear these sneakers, I appear to be 175cm tall. This boost in height gives me more confidence, which is why I like wearing them.
