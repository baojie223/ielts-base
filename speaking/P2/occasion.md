I want to share an experience of getting lost in Xi'an. During the recent National Day holiday, my girlfriend and I went on a trip to Xi'an together. Xi'an is a famous city with rich historical and cultural heritage, as well as countless delicious local snacks. We planned to try all the famous snacks in the city center.

On the second day of our holiday, we designated it as a food day. We started early in the morning and began trying each item on our food list, eating continuously until evening. We decided to visit a dessert shop called "Pangzi Zengao." However, when we followed the navigation to the specified location, we found that there was no such shop there. We couldn't believe it, so we looked around the area, but still couldn't find it. To make matters worse, we ended up entering a narrow alley that was dark and deserted. We felt cold and scared, and it seemed like we were completely lost.

However, I quickly calmed down and opened the navigation app on my phone. We located the nearest large shopping mall and used the phone's flashlight. After walking for about fifteen minutes, we finally made it out of that alley. Once we were out, we asked some locals why we couldn't find "Pangzi Zengao," and they looked at us strangely. They explained that "Pangzi Zengao" is only sold at the morning market, and it's from a small cart. Of course, you wouldn't find it in the evening. My girlfriend and I exchanged glances and couldn't help but laugh. It turns out that thorough trip planning is essential when traveling!
