I want to talk about one of my favorite childhood games, which was playing basketball. My older brother was a basketball enthusiast, and he would teach me some basketball moves from a young age.

In China, we often played with three people on each team, engaging in three-on-three matches on half of a basketball court. The first team to score five points would win, and the losing team had to step aside and let another team take their place.

I remember during middle school, every time we had physical education class, I would team up with two good friends to compete against other teams. Since the PE class time was short, we worked hard to improve our skills in order to win more games. Eventually, we became one of the strongest teams in our class.

I believe that playing basketball in this way was very meaningful. It not only improved my physical fitness but also enhanced my teamwork skills. During this process, I strengthened my friendships with my teammates and made many good friends. However, what saddens me is that after starting work, I haven't had the opportunity to play basketball together again. So, I cherish those happy times a lot.

One of my favorite sports programs is the NBA, which stands for the National Basketball Association. It's the highest-level basketball league in the world, featuring many renowned players like LeBron James and Stephen Curry.

Typically, when I'm at home, I watch the games on the CCTV5 channel on my television because their commentators provide the best analysis. When I can't watch on TV, I use the Tencent Sports app on my phone, which is convenient as I can watch from anywhere.

Whenever there's an opportunity, I gather with my friends to watch NBA games. We usually pick a weekend morning, gather at my place, prepare plenty of snacks, and then enjoy the games while chatting and evaluating how well the players perform.

There are several reasons why I love watching the NBA. Firstly, I play basketball myself regularly, so I naturally have an interest in high-level basketball matches. Secondly, watching games has become a habit for me, providing a way to unwind from the busyness of work. Lastly, I truly enjoy the camaraderie of watching games with friends, and this bonding experience is the primary reason I love watching sports.
