The experience I'd like to share is a scuba diving adventure. When I was 12 years old, to celebrate my elementary school graduation, my parents took me to Sanya for scuba diving. Sanya is an excellent place for diving because the tropical waters are warm, and the entire island is surrounded by coral reefs, which are home to many beautiful fish you can swim with.

After arriving in Sanya, we purchased a complete set of scuba diving equipment and hired local professional instructors to teach us. Scuba diving is an extreme sport, and it's dangerous to go underwater without proper training. I was a bit nervous at first because I wasn't particularly skilled at swimming, but under the guidance of the instructor, I gradually relaxed and began to appreciate the beauty of the underwater world.

This was a memorable and joyful experience for me. I've always loved the ocean since I was a child, and this scuba diving adventure not only allowed me to see the sea but also allowed me to immerse myself in it, which was incredibly exciting. Moreover, it was a rare family activity. My parents were busy with work when I was young and didn't have much time to spend with me, so this scuba diving trip brought me the happiness of being together as a family. Learning to scuba dive was also an achievement for me because it was the first time I attempted to accomplish something challenging. Despite the difficulties along the way, the end result made me very happy

I'd like to share an experience of going scuba diving in Sanya with my younger cousin. It was during a summer vacation when my cousin had just graduated from junior high school and was at home with nothing to do. My parents took me to Sanya for a vacation, and we decided to bring him along.

Sanya is a fantastic place for scuba diving because the tropical waters are warm, and the entire island is surrounded by coral reefs, which are home to many beautiful fish you can swim with. I had gone scuba diving there when I was younger, so when we arrived in Sanya, I asked my cousin if he wanted to go scuba diving with me, and he immediately agreed.

We rented a complete set of scuba diving equipment. Since I had some experience with scuba diving, I initially planned to teach my cousin myself to save money. However, after struggling for a while, we realized that we couldn't dive properly on our own. I had also forgotten some details, so we decided to hire an instructor.

I found this experience quite interesting because I tried to teach someone else how to scuba dive, something I had never done before. It made me realize that to teach someone, you need to have a sufficient level of expertise yourself; otherwise, it's challenging. I also cherished the joyful moments of playing and goofing around with my cousin underwater. As we grew older, we went to different cities for our careers, making it challenging to get together and have fun like we used to. Perhaps, this is the price of growing up.

The activity I want to talk about that made me feel tired was a scuba diving experience. Last summer, my cousin and I planned to escape the heat by going to Sanya together. Scuba diving was quite popular among young people at the time, so we decided to give it a try. Scuba diving involves wearing a wetsuit, carrying an oxygen tank on your back, which allows you to breathe underwater and explore deeper ocean landscapes.

On the day of the dive, we put on the professional equipment and had an unforgettable diving experience under the guidance of a professional instructor. The sunlight pierced through the sea surface, illuminating the seabed. I saw various types of small fish swimming alongside me, and I even spotted a few baby sharks!

However, when I emerged from the water, I suddenly felt extremely tired, and my whole body felt drained. Since it was my first time diving, I didn't realize that diving could be such a physically demanding activity. Perhaps I need more practice to get better at it.

One of the adventures I'd like to try in the future is scuba diving.

Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving whereby divers use breathing equipment that is completely independent of a surface air supply, and therefore has a limited but variable endurance.

I'm planning to go to Sanya because the seawater there is very warm, and the underwater depths are not too extreme, making it less dangerous. Since my girlfriend has always wanted to visit the seaside, I intend to go together with her.

Scuba diving comes in three main types: recreational diving, technical diving, and commercial diving. Since we don't have scuba certifications, we'll likely enlist the help of professional instructors who will guide us through the process and provide us with a full set of equipment, including diving masks, fins, scuba tanks, and more. Afterward, we can start exploring the underwater world.

I've always been fascinated by marine life, finding them adorable, and swimming alongside them will allow me to experience the wonders of nature. Additionally, scuba diving is a challenging activity, and I'd like to take this opportunity to push my limits. Lastly, many of my friends have already tried this adventure, so I certainly want to give it a shot, or else they'll tease me about it.
