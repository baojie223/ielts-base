I want to share an experience of my computer suddenly crashing.

It was during the summer after I graduated from high school. My parents had bought me a new computer, and I spent my days playing a game called GTA at home, having a great time.

One scorching afternoon, while I was deeply engrossed in the game, my computer suddenly displayed a blue screen. At first, I didn't pay much attention and simply restarted the computer.

However, it soon became apparent that the problem was much more serious. I couldn't open the game anymore, and the computer's screen resolution became extremely low, making it almost unusable. My initial suspicion was that it might be a graphics card driver issue, so I tried updating the graphics card drivers, but the problem persisted.

Subsequently, I speculated that it might be a problem with the computer's operating system, so I decided to reinstall the operating system, hoping it would fix the issue. To my dismay, even after the reinstallation, the problem remained unresolved.

At this point, I was left with no other choice but to take the computer to a computer repair shop, seeking professional assistance. After a week of waiting, I finally received the diagnosis â€“ it turned out that the graphics card was faulty. It was a hardware issue beyond my ability to repair.

This experience taught me to appreciate my computer more and emphasized the importance of regularly backing up important data.
