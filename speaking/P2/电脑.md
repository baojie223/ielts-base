About 10 years ago, shortly after I graduated from high school, my parents bought me a new computer. I used it almost every day to play games. One day, while I was at home playing GTA, my computer suddenly crashed with a blue screen. I immediately restarted it, and it seemed to be working fine, but I noticed that I couldn't open the game anymore.

At first, I wasn't too worried, thinking I could fix it myself. I started searching on Google for relevant information and followed the steps outlined in various guides. However, to my frustration, after trying several methods, including updating graphics drivers and reinstalling the computer's operating system, the problem persisted.

At that point, I realized I couldn't resolve the issue on my own, so I took the computer to a computer repair parlour. Their diagnosis revealed that the computer's graphics card was faulty. I ended up paying a significant amount to replace the graphics card, finally resolving the problem, but many of the data on the computer were lost.

This experience taught me a valuable lesson: always make sure to back up data regularly in the future.
