Why he/she moved to a new place
rest of department
grown tired of

And explain whether his/her move has had a positive impact on you
increace my workload
hesitant
trying new things

The most recent person I know who moved is my supervisor at work, named Xiaozhang. He is originally from Liaoning and had been working in Beijing before.And now he has moved to Shanghai.

Before moving, he often asked me about the best areas to find an apartment near our office. I recommended the area where I live. In the end, he chose to live in the same apartment complex as me, although his apartment has a different layout. His apartment is around 50 square meters, which is more spacious than mine. It has a kitchen, a bedroom, and a bathroom. What's even more enviable is his large balcony. I can't help but imagine how happy I would be if I had such a balcony. Unfortunately, apartments with such layouts are too expensive.

As first, I konw that he decided to move to Shanghai because the rest of our department is located in Shanghai, and he can make work-related communication with our department members much easier. However, I also asked him privately if there were other reasons. He told me that he was frastrated with the environment in Beijing and wanted to experience a new life elsewhere.

Initially, I wasn't very pleasant when I found that he would come to Shanghai because it meant he would have more time to supervise our work, which would increase my workload. However, when I learned that he was leaving behind his apartment, car, and boyfriend in Beijing just to experience a new life in Shanghai, I was amazed by his determination. To be honest, I've always been a hesitant person, preferring to think things through before taking action. But from his decision to move, I suddenly realized that life is about being willing to try new things, letting go of the unimportant, and always sticking to one's inner desires. This might be the true meaning of life.

I want to talk about a party hosted by my friend Xiao Zhang last month. The main purpose of this party was to celebrate his housewarming, and he invited over ten friends to have an outdoor party at Dixui Lake.

We went to the supermarket in advance and bought a lot of fresh seafood and vegetables. When we arrived at the campsite, we set up tents together and prepared the barbecue grill. After that, the party began, and we started grilling, filling the air with the aroma of various ingredients. After the meal, with the gentle breeze from the lake, some of us played Texas Hold'em, some played the game "Werewolf," and others gathered to chat and drink. The atmosphere at the scene was very lively.

I really enjoyed this party because, after starting work, it's rare to have the opportunity to gather with so many friends. This party was filled with laughter, delicious food, and friendship. We gathered together to talk about life and dreams, which made me feel incredibly happy and relaxed. At the same time, this party allowed me to experience the beauty of friendship and nature, and I hope we can have another party together in the future.
