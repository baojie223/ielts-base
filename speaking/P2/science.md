I'm interested in the field of artificial intelligence, which is a branch of computer science aimed at enabling computer systems to simulate human intelligence. Specifically, artificial intelligence aims to enable computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as facial recognition and autonomous driving.

When I was in school, I had heard about artificial intelligence, but at that time, it was just a distant concept, seemingly impossible to achieve. It wasn't until last year when ChatGPT emerged that I was surprised to discover how powerful artificial intelligence has become. It can even assist humans in planning and coding. This renewed my interest in artificial intelligence.

So, I've been learning about this field from multiple sources. On one hand, I watch videos on platforms like YouTube, where experts from around the world share the latest AI technologies. On the other hand, I'm actively applying for a master's program in artificial intelligence because education at a university provides a comprehensive and structured knowledge base.

Of course, there are many reasons why I'm interested in this field. First, I've always found artificial intelligence fascinating since I was a kid, and my childhood interest has persisted to this day. Second, I'm a software engineer myself, and AI has a significant impact on software development, so I want to understand it better. Lastly, AI is the future trend, and learning it can help me stay relevant and potentially find better job opportunities.

Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science, commonly referred to as AI. Its primary objective is to simulate human behavior using computers, enabling them to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

AI serves various purposes, such as at high-speed train stations, where it assists in facial recognition to ensure the accuracy of passengers' identity information. In the realm of autonomous driving, AI aids in route planning, road condition recognition, and ensures a safe driving journey for humans.

AI technology is becoming increasingly popular. For instance, the current trend of ChatGPT, which can answer nearly all questions, and various AI-driven art platforms have even led to the unemployment of many designers.

While AI indeed possesses powerful capabilities, there is no need to worry about its complexity in usage. The primary purpose behind creating AI is to simplify human life and enhance its quality. In most cases, we only need to make a simple gesture or speak a few words, and AI can assist us in achieving our desired outcomes. Therefore, without a doubt, AI is the future for humanity.

The career I aspire to in the future is that of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) engineer. This role primarily involves finding efficient methods to train machine or deep learning models and applying the trained models in various applications, such as facial recognition and autonomous driving.

To pursue this career, the first step is to pursue a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence. Following that, one needs to conduct research and publish papers in the field of AI, leveraging these research accomplishments to secure suitable job opportunities.

AI engineers should have a solid foundation in computer science and be proficient in using algorithm frameworks. I currently work as a software engineer, which has provided me with a fundamental understanding of computer science. Therefore, I am actively working towards applying for a master's program in Artificial Intelligence, with the hope of entering this promising industry.

In fact, my interest in AI dates back to my early years, but at that time, AI remained mostly theoretical and hadn't yet found practical applications. It wasn't until the popularity of technologies like ChatGPT in recent years that I was astonished by how powerful AI has become. This rekindled my interest in AI. However, AI development is a challenging field that requires continuous deep exploration and pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. The joy of such exploration is precisely what makes AI engineering an appealing profession.
