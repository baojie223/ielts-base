When I was in high school, our English teacher introduced a daily speech segment to improve our oral communication skills. Each student had to give a 5-minute speech in front of the whole class, and there were no restrictions on the topic.

At that time, I was quite introverted and afraid of speaking in public. So when my turn came, I was very nervous. Due to my interest in basketball, I decided to talk about the achievements of NBA player Jeremy Lin. I prepared for this speech a day in advance, gathered relevant information online, created a PowerPoint presentation, and practiced in front of a mirror dozens of times to ensure I wouldn't embarrass myself in front of my classmates.

On the day I had to speak, I was still a bit nervous initially, but I gradually relaxed and delivered the speech smoothly. To my surprise, my English teacher even gave me the highest score.

This experience gradually changed me. I realized that speaking in front of a crowd wasn't as scary as I thought, as long as I was well-prepared. It also boosted my confidence and made me less fearful of interacting with others, making me more willing to express my thoughts. This speech can be considered a turning point in my journey towards becoming more extroverted, and I'm truly grateful for it.
