Coming to work in Shanghai was a very important decision I made. Two years after graduating from college, I left my hometown of Wuxi and came to Shanghai alone. 

The reason was quite simple: I work in software development, and Wuxi didn't have many good internet companies, while Shanghai offered more job opportunities. However, having more opportunities also requires us to have the capability to seize them. So, for the first two years, I focused on learning more about development, gaining work experience, and building a strong foundation. Once everything was in place, I decided to move to Shanghai.

This decision eventually led me to join a top-tier internet company and earn a substantial salary. Moving to Shanghai and living on my own also gave me more personal time to do the things I wanted.

I often reflect on what this decision has brought me. Firstly, joining a top internet company significantly raised the ceiling of my career, allowing me to work with more accomplished individuals and learn from their strengths. Secondly, being far away from my hometown and parents, starting a life on my own, made me braver and more willing to face many challenges by myself. Therefore, this decision represents the beginning of taking control of my own life and marks my growth and maturity.

I want to share the moment when I made the decision to move to Shanghai for work. It was in the spring of 2021, following a heated argument with my supervisor. I returned to my desk and realized that I couldn't fulfill my potential at the current company, and it was hindering my career growth.

So, I started interviewing with numerous internet companies in Shanghai, including some top-tier ones. After nearly a month of effort, I finally received an offer from ByteDance. Subsequently, I packed my bags and ventured to Shanghai alone, embarking on a new chapter in my life.

I am immensely grateful to my impulsive decision at that time. If I hadn't come to Shanghai, I might still be doing repetitive and meaningless work. I also consider myself fortunate because if the company didn't have job openings at that moment, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to join a big tech firm.

Today, my life has improved significantly. Entering a big tech company has raised the ceiling of my career, resulting in a higher income that can support my family. Moreover, I have gained more personal time to pursue my dreams. This marks the beginning of me taking full control of my life.
