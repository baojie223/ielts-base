I still remember how I was nervous when I was waiting the enrollment letter from my dream university. That day was the most special day in my life. I felt like I had waited for a century for that moment to come.

After graduating from high school, I took the most important exam, called national college entrance examination, also known as gao kao , I was waiting for the results anxiously the whole summer. And then the results came out, and I got really good grades, I knew I had a big chance of getting accepted into my dream school , but I wasn’t 100% sure. So I kept waiting and waiting.

On august 10th, i still remember the date clearly, I got a call from post office, telling me that I was supposed to get a very important letter that day. I knew it was the letter I had been waiting for. I still remember how I was on the edge of the seat the whole morning, I was biting my nails, having butterflies in my stomach , and felt like I had my heart in my mouth.

Finally, the mailman knocked on the door, when I heard him knocking, I almost couldn’t breathe. I got the letter from him, and opened the envelope with shaky hands. I saw the letter that I had been waiting for to see for two months. It almost brought me to tear. Words couldn’t describe my feeling, I will never forget that day.
