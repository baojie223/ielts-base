I'd like to share my story of self-learning programming.

In 2018, I graduated from university, and due to failing my postgraduate entrance exam, I missed the campus recruitment season and couldn't find a job. After spending a few days at home, I realized that I had a task at hand â€“ to learn a new skill and find a job as quickly as possible. After comparing various options, I decided to embark on self-learning programming because there were abundant online resources available for learning.

I then created a six-month plan: the first three months were dedicated to studying the fundamentals of programming, and the following three months were for working on practical projects to showcase during job interviews. My primary learning methods involved reading classic books and watching instructional videos on YouTube. I had almost no leisure time for six months, and it was incredibly challenging. Fortunately, I successfully found a job and accomplished my goal.

Self-learning programming was indeed a formidable task. Firstly, I had no prior computer science knowledge, and it usually takes four years of university education to cover what I aimed to learn in just six months. Secondly, I had to overcome my own procrastination tendencies and avoid distractions like video games and short videos.

I take great pride in completing this task. Not only did it help me secure a job, but it also laid a solid foundation for my subsequent entry into a prestigious tech company. Moreover, it marked the first time in my life that I set a challenging goal for myself and successfully achieved it. I am not aware of anyone in my circle who has undertaken such rigorous self-learning. This experience has boosted my confidence, and I now have the courage to face even more daunting challenges. Therefore, I am truly proud of it.
