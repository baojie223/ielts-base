I find the city of Xi'an interesting. It's the capital of Shaanxi Province and is located in the central part of China. It was once the capital of 13 dynasties and boasts a rich cultural heritage. Every year, it attracts thousands of tourists for sightseeing.

I have a relative who used to work in Xi'an, and he often talks about his experiences there, like dining near the ancient city wall and visiting various historical architectural sites. I always find his stories fascinating and have started dreaming of visiting Xi'an someday.

Xi'an has two main characteristics. One is its rich cultural heritage, with many historical sites and relics from various dynasties, like Giant Wild Goose Pogoda and ancient city wall, allowing people to fully experience the weight of history. The other is its cuisine. Xi'an is known as the capital of noodles, with unique dishes like 'roujiamo' (Chinese hamburger) and 'biangbiang noodles'.

I believe Xi'an has beautiful natural and cultural landscapes. In terms of natural scenery, it boasts Huashan, one of China's Five Great Mountains, with its magnificent landscapes including rugged peaks and ancient trees. Regarding cultural landscapes, Xi'an has many people dressed in traditional Hanfu clothing, strolling through the ancient city at night, giving the feeling of being transported back to the glorious days of the Tang Dynasty. With so many beautiful places to explore, I can't wait to visit Xi'an.

I have a relative who used to work in Xi'an, and he often talks about his experiences there, such as riding a bicycle on the ancient city wall and climbing one of the Five Great Mountains, Mount Hua. I always find his stories fascinating and have started dreaming of visiting Xi'an someday.

The other is its cuisine. Xi'an is known as the capital of noodles, with unique dishes like 'roujiamo' (Chinese hamburger) and 'biangbiang noodles'.

The most interesting place for me is the Terracotta Army, which is a collection of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China. Witnessing the wisdom and craftsmanship of people from thousands of years ago is truly fascinating. Additionally, Xi'an has many people dressed in traditional Hanfu clothing. Walking through the Great Tang All Day Mall at night while wearing Hanfu makes you feel like you've traveled back in time, and it's a truly unique experience. I can't wait to visit Xi'an.

I would like to talk about the experience of a car journey in which my girlfriend and I rent a car and traveled in Xian. It's the capital of Shanxi Province and is located in the central part of China. It was once the capital of 13 dynasties and boasts a rich cultural heritage. Every year, it attracts thousands of tourists for sightseeing. We had a 5-day holiday there.

At first, we planned to use public transportation to get around Xi'an, but we realized that the Terracotta Army and Huashan, the places we wanted to visit, were quite far from our hotel, and public transportation wasn't very convenient. So, we decided to rent a car for a self-driving tour. During our stay in Xi'an, we drove to most of the famous attractions, including the Terracotta Army and Huashan, and experienced the rich natural and cultural landscapes. Plus, having our own car gave us the freedom to explore at our own pace without being restricted by time.

This was a truly impressive and memorable trip for me. On one hand, as I mentioned earlier, self-driving gave us ample time to explore without being constrained by public transportation schedules. However, on the other hand, the traffic in Xi'an was quite congested, which did result in us spending more time on the road. I believe this was mainly due to the fact that we traveled during the National Day holiday. I'm confident that if one were to travel at a different time, self-driving would be an excellent choice.

The photo I'd like to talk about is a picture of my girlfriend and me.

During the recent National Day holiday, my girlfriend and I went on a trip to Xi'an. Xi'an, known as the ancient capital of thirteen dynasties, boasts many historical sites, making it an ideal place for taking photos in traditional Chinese clothing, known as Hanfu. So, we spent 500 RMB and hired a local photographer to take pictures for us.

In the photo, both of us are dressed in Hanfu attire. She looks like a graceful lady, and I appear to be a royal guard. I'm gently holding her chin with my right hand, while my left hand rests on a sword, and I'm looking at her with a smile. She's slightly tilting her head, holding a fan in both hands, and displaying a shy expression. The background features a brilliantly lit palace, softened with a subtle filter, creating a dreamy ambiance. The whole photo seems like a playful scene of a warrior teasing a modest lady, and it's quite amusing.

I now look at this picture almost every day, and I've even set it as my phone wallpaper. Every time I see it, it brings back wonderful memories of our trip to Xi'an. Moreover, it was my first time wearing Hanfu, which was a fascinating experience for me. Most importantly, our relationship grew even closer during the trip and the photoshoot, which is the most heartwarming part for me.

The drawing I'd like to talk about my girlfriend and me.

During the recent National Day holiday, my girlfriend and I went on a trip to Xi'an. Xi'an, known as the ancient capital of thirteen dynasties, boasts many historical sites, making it an ideal place for dressing in traditional Chinese clothing, known as Hanfu.

One day, while we were wearing Hanfu and taking photos near the ancient city wall, a person approached us and asked if we wanted a portrait done. He offered to draw a cute caricature portrait for 50 RMB, which we thought was quite reasonable. So, we struck a pose, and he began to create our caricature portrait.

It is a portrait featured adorable Q-style characters which looks really cute. In the drawing, both of us are dressed in Hanfu attire. She looks like a graceful lady, and I appear to be a royal guard. I'm gently holding her chin with my right hand, while my left hand rests on a sword, and I'm looking at her with a smile. She's slightly tilting her head, holding a fan in both hands, and displaying a shy expression. The background features a brilliantly lit palace which creating a dreamy ambiance. The whole drawing seems like a playful scene of a warrior teasing a modest lady, and it's quite amusing.

I now look at this picture almost every day, and I've even set it as my phone wallpaper. Every time I see it, it brings back wonderful memories of our trip to Xi'an. Moreover, it was my first time wearing Hanfu, which was a fascinating experience for me. Most importantly, our relationship grew even closer during the trip, which is the most heartwarming part for me.
